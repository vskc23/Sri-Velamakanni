      "I am a Software Engineer with a Master's in Computer Science from Penn State University, specializing in large-scale distributed systems and enterprise fintech solutions across payments, settlements, and transaction processing. My professional journey includes building scalable Java/Spring Boot microservices, distributed caching with Hazelcast (improving response times by 40%), CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, React/Redux dashboards for transaction insights, and automated financial reporting pipelines at DBS Bank. Most recently at Walmart Global Tech, I contributed to the next-gen unified settlements platform by onboarding major processors (InComm, Fiserv, Solutran, Amex) and developing Kafka + Spring Batchâ€“driven reconciliation jobs that reconcile 10M+ daily transactions, while also designing and deploying chargeback pipelines for Amex and Discover using Java 17 and Kafka, reducing manual dispute handling by 40% and enabling real-time financial impact classification.",
